This is a Django application I developed, and originally distributed
standalone, which powers the list of open-source projects I maintain
on my personal site.

Since it was pretty narrowly tailored to my use case and never really
gained wider use, I no longer maintain this as a separate application;
the latest code now lives directly in [the repository of my personal
site](https://github.com/ubernostrum/b_list). The code in this
repository is no longer maintained.
